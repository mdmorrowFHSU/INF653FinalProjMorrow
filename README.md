**Description**

This repository shares the code applied during the Youtube tutorials given by Dave Gray, my Fort Hays back end web development instructor. The repository if part of my submission for my final project.


I suggest completing his [8 hour JavaScript course tutorial video](https://youtu.be/EfAl9bwzVZk) if you are new to Javascript.

Hopefully deploying my project this way will actually make it work on the testing site for submission? Lets see!!


Final Submission Copy - needed to add this, I have a few copys made with various changes for comparing what did 
and did not work.
